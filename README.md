# Record Store App

This is a simple app I built using a few new gems and apis including: 
* Stripe - payment processing
* Devise - easy authentification
* CanCan - simple authorization
* AASM - manage my sales states
* DotEnv - simple way to handle environment variables
* Bootstrap - quick front end elements
* Simple Form - for easier form markup
* Friendly Id - for more descriptive urls
